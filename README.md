# Lunch Launch

TODO: Provide a description.

## Roadmap

### Roulette

1. Allow users to manually look up a place (E.G. Cary, NC) and view nearby restaurants on a Google Map.
1. Randomly choose a nearby restaurant and display it as a suggestion.

### Smart

1. Ratings. Allow users to choose a profile out of Undiscovered, Risky, Solid, and All-Star.
   1. Undiscovered: no reviews.
   1. Risky: 4 to 5 stars with a low number of reviews.
   1. Solid: 3.5 to 5 stars with a high number of reviews.
   1. All-Star: 5 stars with a high number of reviews.
1. Distance. Allow users to choose a profile out of Stroll, Trek, and Drive.
1. Advanced. Filter candidates by type (E.G. "Indian") and price range. Maybe the types option is a dropdown populated with the types that are nearby?

### Polish

1. Allow users to view other suggestions.

### Potential

1. Store user information about common disputes (E.G. serving sizes), essentially extending the Google Place information
